# Introduction & Foundations {background-color="#041614"}

## What is a Literature Review?

. . .

### ❌ What it is not:

::: {.incremental}
- [An annotated bibliography.]{.rn-fragment rn-type=strike-through rn-color=tomato}
- [A list of summaries : "Author A said X, Author B said Y".]{.rn-fragment rn-type=strike-through rn-color=tomato}  
- [A comprehensive catalog of everything ever written on a topic.]{.rn-fragment rn-type=strike-through rn-color=tomato} 
- [Book reports strung together.]{.rn-fragment rn-type=strike-through rn-color=tomato} 
:::

## What is a Literature Review?

### ✅ What it is:

::: {.incremental}
- [**Critical**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=lightgreen} analysis of existing research.
- [**Synthesis**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=lightgreen} that creates new understanding.
- An [**argument**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=lightgreen} about the state of knowledge.
- A foundation that [**justifies**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=lightgreen} YOUR research.

## Example Comparison

::: {.panel-tabset}

### ❌ **POOR**
[**Summary approach:**]{.rn-fragment rn-type=strike-through rn-strokeWidth=5 rn-color=red} Smith (2020) found that online learning was effective. Jones (2021) also studied online learning and found it helped students. Kumar (2022) researched remote education and discovered benefits.

### ✅ **GOOD** 
[**Synthesis approach:**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=lightgreen} Research consistently demonstrates the effectiveness of online learning, though results vary by context (Smith, 2020; Jones, 2021; Kumar, 2022). While undergraduate populations show positive outcomes, graduate-level effectiveness remains underexplored, particularly in professional education (Lee, 2023).

# Reading & Analysis Strategies {background-color="#041614"}

## Strategic Reading

<br>

> Not all papers deserve equal time.

<br>

. . .

> Strategic reading means knowing WHEN to [**skim**]{.rn-fragment}, when to read [**carefully**]{.rn-fragment}, and when to study [**deeply**]{.rn-fragment}.

## [Pass 1: SKIM]{.rn-fragment rn-color=lightgreen} (5-10 minutes per paper) 

::: {.incremental}

- [**Read:**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=lightgreen} Title, Abstract, Introduction (first few paragraphs), Conclusion
- [**Scan:**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=lightgreen} Section headings, figures, tables
- [**Decision:**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=lightgreen} Is this relevant to my question? Keep or discard?
- [**Outcome:**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=lightgreen} Sort into "Highly Relevant," "Moderately Relevant," "Not Relevant"

:::

## [Pass 2: ACTIVE READING]{.rn-fragment rn-color=orange} (20-30 minutes per paper) {.smaller}

- [**Do this for:**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=orange} "Highly Relevant" papers
- [**Read:**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=orange} Full paper but strategically
    - Introduction: What's the question and why does it matter?
    - Methods: How did they study it? Appropriate?
    - Results: What did they find? (Read carefully)
    - Discussion: What do THEY think it means?
- [**Action:**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=orange} Highlight key points, take structured notes
- [**Ask:**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=orange} What's the main contribution? How does this relate to MY question?

## [Pass 3: DEEP READING]{.rn-fragment rn-color=tomato} (1-2 hours per paper) {.smaller}

- [**Do this for:**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=tomato} 5-10 most critical papers
- [**Read:**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=tomato} Every word, every citation, every detail
- [**Action:**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=tomato}
    - Detailed notes on methodology
    - Critique strengths and limitations
    - Follow up on key citations
    - Connect to theoretical frameworks
- [**Ask:**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=tomato} Can I reproduce their logic? What are unstated assumptions?

## Key Principles {.scrollable}

1. [**Consistency**]{.rn-fragment rn-type=box rn-color=green}
    - Use the same format for every paper
    - Makes it easier to compare and synthesize later

1. [**Distinguish**]{.rn-fragment rn-type=box rn-color=green}
    - Author's words (mark as quotes with page numbers)
    - Your paraphrase (cite but no quotes)
    - Your own analysis/thoughts (clearly marked)
    - This prevents accidental plagiarism

1. [**Action-Oriented**]{.rn-fragment rn-type=box rn-color=green}
    - Always note: "How does this relate to MY research?"
    - Tag by themes you're seeing emerge

1. [**Connected**]{.rn-fragment rn-type=box rn-color=green}
    - Note relationships to other papers
    - Build your own web of literature

## [Pro Tips ✅ DO:]{.rn-fragment rn-color=lightgreen}

- Take [**notes immediately**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=lightgreen} after reading (while fresh)
- Always [**include page**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=lightgreen} numbers for quotes
- [**Tag/categorize**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=lightgreen} by emerging themes
- Note your [**gut reactions**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=lightgreen} and questions

## [Pro Tips ❌ DON'T:]{.rn-fragment rn-color=tomato}

- Just highlight in the [**PDF**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=tomato} (you'll never look again)
- Rely on [**memory**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=tomato} (you'll forget)
- [**Copy**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=tomato} large chunks without paraphrasing (plagiarism risk)
- Wait until you've [**read 20 papers**]{.rn-fragment rn-color=tomato} to start taking notes (overwhelming)

## Synthesis (What you should do) {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[Research consistently demonstrates benefits of online learning, though these vary by context and outcome measure. Effectiveness studies show positive learning outcomes in STEM fields (Smith, 2020; Lee, 2021), while access studies highlight particular benefits for geographically isolated students (Kumar, 2022; Wang, 2023). However, most existing research focuses on undergraduate populations in North American contexts, leaving gaps in our understanding of graduate-level online learning in the Global South (Jones, 2021).]{.rn-fragment rn-type=bracket rn-color=green}

## The "So What?" Test

After writing your literature review, ask:

- Why does this matter?
- How does this justify MY research?
- What unique contribution will I make?
- Is it clear what gap I'm addressing?
